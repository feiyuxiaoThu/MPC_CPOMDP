Install completed. If executing any of the installed
binaries results in an error that shared libraries cannot
be found, you may need to
  - add 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' to your ~/.bashrc (Linux)
  - add 'export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' to ~/.bashrc (OS X)


If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'
